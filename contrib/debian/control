Description: Container debugging tool based on Linux mount API
 cntr is a replacement for docker exec that brings all your developer
 tools with you by mounting the file system from one container or the
 host into the target container.
 .
 This allows shipping minimal runtime images in production while still
 having access to debugging tools when needed.
 .
 Requires Linux kernel 5.2 or later.
